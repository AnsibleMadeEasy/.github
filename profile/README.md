# Ansible Made Easy

Welcome to the Ansible Made Easy GitHub organization! 

**About Us:**

* **Mission:** To promote Ansible adoption in the create community I have compiled my work into a repeatable and configurable environment using containers. This allows anyone to stand up a moke infrastructure without the need of purchasing resources.  
* **Full Disclosure:** While the setup environment is to be used for testing only and not meant to replace a production infrastructure. The roles I provide have been tested and are produciton ready. Lins to the Galaxy artifact are included below.
* **Legal Disclosure:** Not sure that I even need this, but better safe than sorry. I do not work for or represent Red Hat Enterprise Linux in any capacity. All of the information and resources provided here are on a fully volunteer basis.  

**How to Get Involved:**


**Key Repositories:**

* **[Ansible Training Session](https://github.com/AnsibleMadeEasy/Ansible-Training-Session.git):** This project is designed to provide you with a development environment utilizing containers to simulate usage in a production environment. 
* **[Ansible Pull](https://github.com/AnsibleMadeEasy/ansible-pull.git):** This role provides a means for deploying the Ansible pull mechanism to target systems. This gives you a 'fire and forget' option to configuration management.
