# Ansible Made Easy

Welcome to the Ansible Made Easy GitHub organization! 

**About Us:**

* **Mission:** To promote Ansible adoption in the create community I have compiled my work into a repeatable and configurable environment using containers. This allows anyone to stand up a moke infrastructure without the need of purchasing resources.  
* **Full Disclosure:** While the setup environment is to be used for testing only and not meant to replace a production infrastructure. The roles I provide have been tested and are produciton ready. Lins to the Galaxy artifact are included below.
* **Legal Disclosure:** Not sure that I even need this, but better safe than sorry. I do not work for or represent Red Hat Enterprise Linux in any capacity. All of the information and resources provided here are on a fully volunteer basis.
